 Code Refactor

In this repository I have made efforts to structure the HTML and CSS in a way that is better understood in todays community. 
The index file now has a better structure which makes it a more readable code. As for the CSS file I have admitily made very few chages as i was having issues in maintaing the desired display of the website. 
Once I becomre more proficent in CSS i certaianly will make an effort to refactor further.
